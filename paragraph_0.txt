 devotion will be like a misfire. Therefore, says the Gita: Have devotion, and knowledge will follow. This devotion is not mere lip worship, it is a wrestling with death. 1 Hence the Gitas assessment of the devotees qualities is similar to that of the sages. 17. Thus the devotion required by the Gita is no soft hearted effusiveness. It certainly is not blind faith. The devotion of the Gita has the least to do with externals. A devotee may use, if he likes, rosaries, forehead marks, make offerings, but these things 2 are no test of his devotion. He is the devotee who is jealous of none, who is a fount of mercy, who is without egotism, who is selfless, who treats alike cold and heat, happiness and misery, who is ever forgiving, who is always contented, whose resolutions are firm, who has dedicated mind and soul to God, who causes no dread, 3 who is not afraid of others 4 , who is free from exultation, sorrow and fear, who is pure, who is versed in action and yet remains unaffected by it, who renounces all fruit, good or bad, who treats friend and foe alike, who is untouched by respect or disrespect, who is not puffed up by praise, who does not go under when people speak ill of him, who loves silence and solitude, who has a disciplined reason. 5 Such devotion is inconsistent with the existence at the same time of strong attachments.
